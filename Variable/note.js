/*
when reasising values it will depend of the type
what happens if a new memory location is chosen
or the values is replaces on the original memory loc

Variable names are refered by identifiers!
variables declared by let var
constants declared by const
property names of objects
function names
function parameters
class names

global object property names are included as variable names
but other property objects not really

you can initilialize variables with out assigin ing value
this sets them as undefined

const store values that remain the same throughout the 
execution of a program, a block within the
program or a function

Scope
let and constatn same block scope
variable Z declared OUTSIDE of X block, then
Z can be edited within X in a X or sub.X block
vriable declred inside of X block it wont be
accesed outside of X blcok

not declaring with let const or var is dangerous
it will affect your global variables
since if not declared it assumes you are refering
to the the golobal scope
